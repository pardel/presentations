## June 2023 - DevTalks Romania: Adventures in Flutter-land

There is always that business lure to save money and "build once, deploy everywhere"; and it might work for a short while but long term support is a nightmare. The community is full of stories of rewrites. In this keynote, we'll take Flutter for a spin and see if it lives to its hype. It does have a big name behind it and one must wonder why does Google provide an alternative to its native tools. Come and find out!
