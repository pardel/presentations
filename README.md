## Adventures in Flutter-land @ DevTalks Romania, June 2023

There is always that business lure to save money and "build once, deploy everywhere"; and it might work for a short while but long term support is a nightmare. The community is full of stories of rewrites. In this keynote, we'll take Flutter for a spin and see if it lives to its hype. It does have a big name behind it and one must wonder why does Google provide an alternative to its native tools. Come and find out!

## The brave new world of SwiftUI @ DevTalks Reimagined (online), 2020

Apple's description of SwiftUI is: "an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces 
across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift". In this talk, we'll explore the process of building 
a simple messaging app using this new shiny tool and the opportunity and challenges it brings across.
